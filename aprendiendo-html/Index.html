        <h1>Once told me</h1>
        <h2>The world is gonna roll me</h2>
        <h3>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed</h3>
        <p>She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
            Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>
        <p> So much to do, so much to see
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
            You'll never know if you don't go
            You'll never shine if you don't glow
            Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
            Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
